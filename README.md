## Features
- The monthly installment is calculated using an interest rate of 7.9%.
- Each credit is assigned a unique serial number based on its creation date in the format (Y-m)-0000000x. For example, if two credits are created in September, their serial numbers will be 2024-09-0000001 and 2024-09-0000002.
- If a payment is made that exceeds the remaining balance, the user will be notified, and the balance will be set to zero.
- A recipient's total credit cannot exceed 80,000 BGN.
